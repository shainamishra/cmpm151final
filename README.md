# CMPM 151 Final
CMPM 151 Final Project: Audio Design for a Game Scene

Due Date: 3/15/2022 @ 11:59pm PST

 

Using various techniques and approaches covered throughout the course, design sound effects and music for a game scene in the Unity game engine.

 

This project will be conducted in groups of 2-4 people.

 

The project must exhibit 3 areas of focus:

Procedural Audio. It must exhibit implementation of a minimum of 3 unique sound effects constructed using PD that are implemented into the Unity scene either via OSC or Heavy.
Audio Reactivity. There must be elements in the scene that are audio reactive.
Algorithmic Composition. It must contain music that exhibits at least one of the algorithmic composition approaches covered: vertical re-orchestration, horizontal re-sequencing, generative composition, or branching.
 

Include a document that critiques and summarizes your project work. It should include 2 sections, one that critiques the audio in the scene and another that summarizes the contributions of each group member. The following guidelines should be followed:

Include a critique of how the audio/music complements the game scene by addressing the following:
What is the purpose/function/genre of the game scene, and how does the audio complement it? 
Are there elements to the audio/music that are diegetic/non-diegetic?
What and how do certain musical/audio features (such as tempo, effects processing, waveform design, timbre, melody/harmony, etc...) contribute to the sound design?
Is there immersion present in the sound design?
Include a summary of each group member's contribution to the project.
The document should be about 2 pages (500 words, 12 pt font,  double spaced). 
 

Projects will be presented to the class with the following guidelines:

Presentation time is 10 minutes.
Each group member should describe their role with the project.
Present the audio / musical elements constructed for the scene and demonstrate their implementation.
Focus on the game audio, music, and sonic interaction (NOT the game design, graphics, or game objects present in the scene).
BE PREPARED!!! Rehearse to ensure that the presentation goes smoothly. Make sure everything works and there is no fumbling around.
 

NOTE: you may do something unique upon proposal and approval.

 

Submission guidelines:

Submit all relevant Pure Data patch files (.pd).
Submit the project writeup (.pdf format).
Submit an instructional document (.pdf format) that outlines how pure data interacts with the Unity scene and how to use the pd patch.
Include a video that demonstrates the audio interactivity with the game scene.
Submit all files in a .zip format. The zipped directory should include all Pure Data patch files (.pd), a project writeup (.pdf), an instructions document (.pdf), and the demonstration video.
 

Grading criteria:

50% project level of complexity, depth, and creativity.
25% project exhibits the criteria listed above.
25% effective project writeup and presentation.
